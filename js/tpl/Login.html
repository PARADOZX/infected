<p><b>Please do not block my application!</b>  I have thoroughly tested the Facebook login button on Chrome, Firefox, IE, Opera, and Safari and it worked on each browser.</p>
<br/>
<p>Very rarely the Facebook SDK does not load (I suspect it may have something to do with the AMD loader I'm using; this has happened maybe 3 or 4 times ever) and clicking the Facebook login button will not prompt the login window.  Reloading the page a couple times usually does the trick.</p>
<br />
<p>The "Please log into this app" message shows up everytime you click on the Facebook login button.  This is normal.  
<u>For the app to function properly please ensure that pop-ups are allowed and, if asked, share your location.</u></p>
<br />
<p>Thank you!</p>
